        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>4 yellow onions</li>
            <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
            <li>1 tsp allspice</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp ground cloves</li>
            <li>2.5 vegetable broth</li>
            <li>1 cup jasmine rice</li>
            <li>1 cup brown lentils</li>            
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Thinly slice the onions and add them to a large pot with the olive oil.</li>
            <li>Cook over low heat, stirring frequently for one hour, or until they are deeply golden brown, sticky, and caramelized.</li>
            <li>Remove half of the onions and set them aside to top the pilaf after cooking</li>
            <li>Add the cumin, allspice, and cloves to the pot with the remaining onions. Saut√© for about one minute to lightly toast the spices.</li>
            <li>Add the vegetable broth and stir the pot well to dissolve any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pot.</li>
            <li>Add the rice and lentils to the pot. Cover the pot with a lid and turn the heat up to high.</li>
            <li>Allow the contents to come up to a boil. As soon as it reaches a full boil, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 30 minutes, turn the heat off and let it rest for 10 minutes without removing the lid.</li>
            <li>Finally, remove the lid, fluff with a spoon or fork, then top with the reserved caramelized onions. Serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
