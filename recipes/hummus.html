        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 15 ounce can of chickpeas</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/4 cup tahini</li>
            <li>1-4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons EV olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>2-3 tablespoons of water</li>
            <li>dash of paprika</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In the bowl of a food processor, combine the tahini and lemon juice and process for 1 minute, scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl then process for 30 seconds more. </li>
            <li>Add the olive oil, minced garlic, cumin, and a 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the whipped tahini and lemon juice. Process until well blended.</li>
            <li>Open, drain, and rinse the chickpeas. Add half of the chickpeas to the food processor and process until well blended</li>
            <li>Most likely the hummus will be too thick or still have tiny bits of chickpea. To fix this, with the food processor turned on, slowly add 2 to 3 tablespoons of water until you reach the perfect consistency.</li>
            <li>Taste for salt and adjust as needed. Serve hummus with a drizzle of olive oil and dash of paprika. Store homemade hummus in an airtight container and refrigerate up to one week.</li>
        </ol>
